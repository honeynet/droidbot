# DroidBot

## About
DroidBot is a lightweight test input generator for Android.
It can send random or scripted input events to an Android app, achieve higher test coverage more quickly, and generate a UI transition graph (UTG) after testing.

A sample UTG is shown [here](http://honeynet.github.io/droidbot/report_com.yelp.android/).

DroidBot has the following advantages as compared with other input generators:

1. It does not require system modification or app instrumentation;
2. Events are based on a GUI model (instead of random);
3. It is programmable (can customize input for certain UI);
4. It can produce UI structures and method traces for analysis.

## Prerequisite

1. `Python` version `2.7`
2. `Java` version `1.7`
3. `Android SDK`
4. Add `platform_tools` directory in Android SDK to `PATH`
5. (Optional) `OpenCV-Python` if you want to run DroidBot in cv mode.

## How to install

### Installation from Package
Archlinux (AUR): https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/droidbot-git/

### Installation from Source
Clone this repo and intall with `pip`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot.git
pip install -e droidbot
```

If successfully installed, you should be able to execute `droidbot -h`. 

## How to use

1. Make sure you have:

    + `.apk` file path of the app you want to analyze.
    + A device or an emulator connected to your host machine via `adb`.

2. Start DroidBot:

    ```
    droidbot -a <path_to_apk> -o output_dir
    ```
    That's it! You will find much useful information, including the UTG, generated in the output dir.

    + If you are using multiple devices, you may need to use `-d <device_serial>` to specify the target device. The easiest way to determine a device's serial number is calling `adb devices`.
    + On some devices, you may need to manually turn on accessibility service for DroidBot (required by DroidBot to get current view hierarchy).
    + If you want to test a large scale of apps, you may want to add `-keep_env` option to avoid re-installing the test environment every time.
    + You can also use a json-format script to customize input for certain states. Here are some [script samples](script_samples/). Simply use `-script <path_to_script.json>` to use DroidBot with a script.
    + If your apps do not support getting views through Accessibility (e.g., most games based on Cocos2d, Unity3d), you may find `-cv` option helpful.
    + You may find other useful features in `droidbot -h`.

## Evaluation

We have conducted several experiments to evaluate DroidBot by testing apps with DroidBot and Monkey.
The results can be found at [DroidBot Posts](http://honeynet.github.io/droidbot/).
A sample evaluation report can be found [here](http://honeynet.github.io/droidbot/2015/07/30/Evaluation_Report_2015-07-30_1501.html).
